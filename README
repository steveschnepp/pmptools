Miscellaneous tools, mostly for UNIX, when one doesn't have a rich GNU
environment.

The tools are focused on portability by simplicity. They try to emulate an
almost standard CLI command in its the most used way.

The tools are usually written in core Perl, that should be on all the "Hostile"
servers out there :-)
